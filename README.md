Blackjack is a popular card game that is also known as 21. The goal is to get a hand of cards that adds up to 21 points, or as close to 21 points as possible without going over. The value of each card is as follows:

Ace: 1 or 11 points (player's choice)
Face cards (King, Queen, Jack): 10 points
All other cards: face value (e.g. a 4 of hearts is worth 4 points)
